ProjectWork anno 2

Front End for system to check cars entering a parking lot, giving out tickets, opening/closing the bar.

The Web page shows how much the tickets costs per hour, how long people usually park for, how many places are currently free 
and a grid with all the parkings showing which are free and which are occupied. 
For the occupied ones you can hover over them and see what type of car is parked, the time it entered the parking.
